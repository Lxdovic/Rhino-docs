## Start Coding

Create a file at `my/rhino/project/hello-world.ri`:

```jsx title="my/rhino/project/hello-world.ri"
println("Hello World!")
```

You can compile and run your program using the following commands:

```bash
> rhino my/rhino/project/hello-world.ri -o myProgramName
> ./myProgramName
```
