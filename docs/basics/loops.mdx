# Loops

Loops allows you to iterate over a chunk of code. They can be really useful when trying to resolve common problems

## While loop

While loops expect a [condition](#conditions), as long as the condition is met, the loop will continue.


:::tip Avoid endless loops
To avoid endless while loops, make sure you have either: a condition that gets updated, a break statement, or a return statement.
:::

```ts title="myWhileLoop.ri"
var index = 0

// highlight-start
while (index < 10) {
    println(string(index))
    index = index + 1 // update index, this also updates the condition
}
```

```shell title="output"
> 0
> 1
> 2
> 3
> 4
> 5
> 6
> 7
> 8
> 9
```
## For loop

For loops expect a lower bound and a higher bound. It will loop and increment the lower bound until it reaches the higher bound.

```ts title="myForLoop.ri"
// highlight-start
for index = 0 to 10 {
    println(string(index))
}
```

```shell title="output"
> 0
> 1
> 2
> 3
> 4
> 5
> 6
> 7
> 8
> 9
```
