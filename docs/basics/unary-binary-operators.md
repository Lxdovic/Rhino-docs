# Unary and Binary Operators

## Unary Operators

Unary operators only affect one value

- [Negation](#negation)
- [Logical Negation](#logical-negation)
- 
### Negation

When declaring a value of type number (`int`, `float`, `double`), you can use the `-` unary operator to negate it

```go
var minusTen: int = -10
```

### Logical Negation

When declaring a value of type bool, you can use the `!` unary operator to negate it

```go
var myTrueVariable: bool = !false
var myFalseVariable: bool = !true
```

## Binary Operators

Binary operators allows you to make calculations.

- `+` - Add two values together
- `-` - Subtract right from left
- `*` - Multiply left with right
- `/` - Divide left by right
- `%` - Get the remainder of left divided by right

### Add

```go
var sum: int = 1 + 2
```

### Subtract

```go
var diff: int = 2 - 1
```

### Multiply

```go
var prod: int = 2 * 3
```

### Divide

```go
var div: int = 6 / 2
```

### Get Remainder

```go
var rem: int = 7 % 3
```
